## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

##### Frontend

1. Homepage:
   - Display a list of featured recipes
   - Include a navigation bar with links to:
     - Home
     - Recipe Categories (e.g., Breakfast, Desserts, Main Courses)
     - Search Page
   - Show a "Load More" button to fetch additional recipes dynamically
2. Recipe Details Page:
   - Fecth and display a specific recipe when a user clicks on it
   - Display recipe information:
     - Title
     - Image
     - Description
     - Ingredients (list format)
     - Steps/Instructions (ordered list format)
     - Cooking time, preparing time, and total time
     - Nutrition information (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
   - Allow users to navigate back to the homepage or search Page
3. Search and Filter Page:
   - Provide a search bar for keyword-based searching (e.g., Chicken)
   - Include filters:
     - Cuisine Type (e.g., Italian, Indian)
     - Difficulty Level (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard)
     - Ingredients (multi-select dropdown)
   - Dynamically render search results as users type or adjust filters.
4. Responsive Design:
   - Ensure the app is mobile-friendly and adjusts appropriately on different screen sizes.
5. User Interactions:
   - Allow users to mark recipes as "Favorites" (bonus: persist this data with local storage or user accounts)
   - Allow sharing recipes via social media or copying a link

##### Backend

1. Recipe Database:
   - Store recipe information with fields:
     - ID, Title, Description, Image URL.
     - Preparing Time, Cooking Time, Total Time.
     - Ingredients (stored as an array)
     - Instructions (stored as an array of steps).
     - Nutrition Information (calories, protein, carbs, fat).
     - Tags (e.g., cuisines, difficulty level).
     - Created/Updated Timestamps
2. API Endpoints:
   - GET /recipes:
     - Fetch all recipes with pagination support (?page=1&limit=10)
   - GET /recipes/:id:
     - Fetch a specific recipe by ID
   - POST /recipes:
     - Add a new recipe (admin-only access).
   - PUT /recipes/:id
     - Update an existing recipe (admin-only access).
   - DELETE /recipes/:id
     - Delete a recipe (admin-only access).
   - GET /recipes/search:
     - Search recipes based on keywords (?q=chicken) and filter criteria (?cuisine=italian&difficulty=easy).
3. Search and Filtering:
   - Use database queries to filter recipes by:
     - Cuisine
     - Difficulty Level
     - Ingredients (match any/all)
   - Implement ful-text search (if using MongoDB, use $text; if MySQL, use FULLTEXT)
4. Authentication (optional)
   - Allow admin users to manage recipes (CRUD)
   - Use JWT for securing API endpoints

#### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Performance:
   - Implement caching (e.g., Redis) to speed up repeated requests for recipe data and search results
   - Optimize database queries for large datasets
2. Scalability:
   - Structure the backend to support additional features like user accounts, comments, or ratings in the future
3. Security:
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL Injection, XSS, etc.
   - Use HTTPS for secure communication
4. Error Handling:
   - Return meaningful error messages for failed API calls (e.g, 404 for "Recipe Not Found").
   - Implement a fallback UI on the frontend for failed data fetching.
5. Accesibility:
   - Ensure the frontend is keyboard-navigable and screen reader-friendly.
6. Documentation:
   - Provide API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) for all endpoints.
   - Write a README file explaining the project structure, setup instructions, and usage

#### Bonus Features (Optional)

1. User Accounts:
   - Allow users to create an account, save favorite recipes, and submit their own recipes.
2. Recipe Ratings and Reviews:
   - Enable users to leave reviews and rate recipes.
3. Image Upload:
   - Allow users or admins to upliad recupe images (use Cloudinary or local storage)
4. Notifications:
   - Notify users when new recipes are added or if a recipe matches their saved preferences.
